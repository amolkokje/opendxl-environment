# OpenDXL Environment

## Overview

The OpenDXL Environment is a pre-configured environment available as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that supports the development and running of OpenDXL solutions. 

The OpenDXL Environment is based on the Centos operating system and includes standard tools and libraries that are commonly used to develop and run OpenDXL solutions. The environment also includes a [web front-end](https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-environment/wiki/Console-Overview) based on [Cloud Commander](http://cloudcmd.io/) that supports browser-based file management, file editing, and terminal access.

The goal of the OpenDXL Environment is to provide a consistent way to develop OpenDXL solutions across platforms and eliminate the need to manually install commonly used tools (git, wget, curl, etc.) and libraries ([OpenDXL Python Client](https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-client-python), [OpenDXL Bootstrap](https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-bootstrap-python)).

The OpenDXL Environment Docker image is available at the following location within [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com):
